### Projects

#### `Good Food iOS App`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6de0833f-85b0-4ed7-ab77-d03e2c1e9968)

The Good Food app, launched in November 2024, offers thousands of expert recipes, restaurant reviews, and culinary advice to nearly 6,000 active users. I had the privilege of working with an exceptionally talented, multidisciplinary team to bring this beloved Australian brand’s app to life within a year.

As part of a four-person iOS engineering team, I not only developed several key features but also took on a tech lead role for multiple initiatives. This involved gathering requirements, liaising with stakeholders across various departments, and serving as the primary point of contact for other engineers.

Here are some of my key engineering contributions to the Good Food app.

* Tech lead for key initiatives — authentication, rich content rendering, custom UX components, data & analytics, and onboarding
* A key initiative I led was transitioning from `RxSwift`, previously used across Nine, to `Combine`
* I averaged 6 PR reviews per sprint for 2 years with positive feedback from engineers and my EM
* Collaborated with a QE to boost test coverage by 55% and reduce CI build times by 50%
* Worked with `Swift`, `SwiftUI`, `UIKit`, `Combine`, `CoreData`, `StoreKit`, `MapKit`, and `CoreLocation`
* Third party integrations included `Firebase`, `Qualtrics`, `Google Places`, `Piano` and `Snowplow` analytics
* Exposure to CI tools `Fastlane` and `Bitrise`

#### `Shaman Pitch Presentation App`

Shaman is a presentation platform that enables its customers to close more deals and was founded by Maurice Van Leeuwen from the Netherlands. Maurice visited me in Dubai back in 2014 to work on Shaman and we started with a team of just 3 people. I was initially incharge of designing the UX, developing the iOS app and managing the development. By 2016, Shaman started gaining momentum with more customers and I helped Maurice expand the Shaman team so that we could move faster. Here were some of the project highlights:

* The app was developed in `Objective C`
* Key Apple Frameworks: `Multipeer` for screen share, `CoreData`, `UICollectionView` and `FileManager` to name a few
* 3rd Party Frameworks: `AFNetworking`, `Crashlytics`, `Sentry`, `SocketCluster`, `GCD Web Server`
* Other interesting technology: `GraphQL`
* Designed the UI / UX for the first 3 years of the app
* Developed several custom controls and UI elements
* Managed a few backend developers for the first 3 years before helping Maurice grow the team

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/shawn-frank/shawn-frank/blob/main/Nespresso-capsule.gif" alt="Nespresso iOS app built in Swift"/>
</p>

Nespresso was preparing to launch the latest Vertuo machine and sought an immersive activation at Mall of the Emirates for existing and potential customers. I was brought in as the technical partner to help create an engaging and memorable experience for the visitors.

![Nespresso (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc108cd6-871c-428f-911d-19e84ce234d7)

* In just one week, over 1,200 people engaged with the activation, receiving such positive feedback that it was later replicated in Kuwait
* The iPad app was built in Swift, with a fully programmatic UIKit UI, leveraging AutoLayout, UIScrollView, and UIView animations
* For data persistence, I used CoreData, UserDefaults, and the documents directory
* Networking and API integration were handled via URLSession
* Multithreading was achieved using DispatchQueues and DispatchGroups
* I then hired and led a backend engineer to build the backend using Laravel and implement integrations with Twilio and SendGrid

#### `Spuble - Real Life Speech Bubbles`

Spuble is a project that I hold quite close to my heart for several reasons. First, it made a real impact in the lives of senior citizens who lost their hearing ability over time. Second, I had the chance to collaborate with some talented people over at Memac Ogilvy. And last, but not least, the app won an award at the [the Dubai Lynx Festival in 2017](https://www2.dubailynx.com/winners/2017/innovation/) in the category of innovative technology. Here was how I was involved:

* Developed the app in `Swift`
* Used `AutoLayout` to scale the app for iPhones & iPads
* Leveraged `localization` to enable the app to support English & Arabic 
* Integrated [Nuance's Dragon Speech to Text SDK](https://www.nuance.com/dragon.html)
* Worked on the UX R&D with Gary (Art Director at Ogilvy) for 8 months to make the app as simple to use as possible
* Pitched the app with Gary at the Dubai Lynx Festival

The app is no longer on the store, so you can learn more about it from the video below.

#### `Harman Kardon`

![Harmon Kardon app screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80219691/215739074-a130532f-ded5-4b5b-a930-855169638bbd.gif)

Harman Kardon stores are built with demonstration capabilities for their entire range of products, however, they wanted to enhance this experience so I was commissioned to work on this project. After several discussions with the Harman team, and their media partners, Mood Media GCC, there was a consensus that an iPad app which not only informed prospective buyers about their range of speakers, but also all allowed them to test drive any speaker that was on display. Here was what I got up to while working on this project:

* Designed and developed a delightful user experience that was on brand, intutitive and engaging
* Developed the iPad app using `Swift`
* Key technology used was `AVPlayer`, `UIKit`, `FileManager` and `AlamoFire`
* `Realm` was the database of choice to store app related content and user interaction data
* Managed a backend developer on this project who was responsible for developing a CMS and Dashboard
* Helped with deploying the app across multiple iPads in different stores across Dubai

The app is not on the App Store, however, I can give you more details if required in person.

#### `Zabeel Ladies Club`

![ZLC screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80219691/215735736-136908d3-0bf3-4976-bca5-f8633280f7ce.gif)

Zabeel Ladies Club (ZLC) has a world class health & fitness facility and their digital precense follows suit for the most part, however, their mobile app was not on brand. I was hired by ZLC to refresh their existing mobile app in terms of user experience and functionality and here were some of my responsibilities:

* Upgrade the user journeys and user experience of the current ZLC mobile app
* Develop the iOS app from scratch using `Swift`
* Program custom UI interface elements, controls and interactions
* Integrated with [MindBody](https://www.mindbodyonline.com/business)
* Integrated with Mux.com to achieve video streaming on demand
* Led a remote team consisting of a `UI Designer`, `Backend Engineer` and an `Android Engineer` while developing the iOS app

The app was handed over to the ZLC team to continue and is currently undergoing QA tests since I was relocating to Australia, however I can share more details about the project in person if required.

### Indie Projects
#### `PanoStory`

![PanoStory_App Screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80219691/215570024-2cc30c54-1661-4305-b83b-a5dfb4b4b989.jpg)

I met a UX designer / product manager named Alex Cox from San Francisco via UpWork when he commissioned me to develop Readers - an app that used an iPhone's camera as a magnifying glass. We enjoyed working together and once readers was launched in early 2021, we started building PanoStory. We found that user's had no easy way to share their Panoramas without cutting them up and so PanoStory converts any panoramic photo into a story-ready video to showcase the beauty of your shots. Here were some of my responsibilities:

* Work with Alex and another designer to finalize the UX of the app
* Developed Pano in `Swift` with several custom UI elements and user experiences
* The complete iterface was developed programatically using `AutoLayout` without storyboards
* Integrated `PhotoKit` to automatically sync Panoramas from the user's gallery
* Leveraged `AVFoundation` & `CoreAnimation` to convert panoramas into videos
* Integrated `StoreKit` so that users could pay to remove ads
* Leveraged `Firebase` for `Push Notifications`, `Crashlytics` and `Event Tracking`

Check out [PanoStory on the App Store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/panostory/id1558262230)

#### `Reliable Radio`

![Reliable Radio App Screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80219691/215565275-470863b7-d081-4f9b-bf7f-aa89cc484a4a.png)

Reliable Radio is the brainchild of an AWS solutions architect named Dawid Gatti. Dawid was the product lead while I was developing an iOS SDK for Banyan (see above). Dawid is based in Italy and often goes for long drives in the mountains where his radio and streaming apps often disconnect due the network being unreachable at some parts. Once discounnected, these apps would not reconnect back which required Dawid to restart the app while driving. Dawid hired me to build Reliable Radio to solve this problem and here are some highlights of the project: <br/>

* Implemented auto reconnect by observing `AVPlayer's` streaming notification and network rechability notifications
* Added `CarPlay` support which was something I had to learn while building this app
* Made use of `CoreData` with `CloudKit` to sycnrhonize user's saved radio stations across all their devices
* Connected with the `iTunes / Apple Music API` in order to display the currently playing song's artwork

The project is no longer live, you can [learn more about Reliable Radio on Product Hunt.](https://www.producthunt.com/products/reliable-radio)</p>

#### `Barakah Coupons`

![Barakah App Screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80219691/215760252-8871158a-73fe-44b0-8d9d-ce7be1a8abc6.png)

Barakah Coupons is a promo code app for online shops that I launched in 2021 with 3 friends. We are currently working on adding a feature to support offline deals. Here is what I was involved in while working on Barakah Coupons:

* Plan the user experience of the app along with a UI designer
* Develop the app using Swift
* The complete iterface was developed programatically using `AutoLayout` without storyboards
* Achieved English & Arabic support using `localization`
* Leveraged `Firebase` for `Push Notifications`, `Crashlytics` and `Event Tracking`
* Managed a backend developer to develop a CMS and dashboard for us
